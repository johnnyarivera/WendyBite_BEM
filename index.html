        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

                The foundation of who I am as a person began in the summer of 2004 in the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
                Playing basketball, I met friends who introduced me to an after-school program called Generation Xcel
                that focused on tutoring and mentoring young children and youth. At this program, I admired the vision
                of the program's leaders and dedicated my time to tutoring kids between the ages of 8 through 13. It
                was here where I learned the core values of Excellence, Creativity, Resourcefulness, Resilience and
                Unity and pledged to be a community leader. At Xcel, I learned about a program called Year Up and I was
                introduced to the Information Technology field. I went on to be accepted, interned at UBS Investment
                Bank, and graduated.
                <br><br>
                Since then, I have developed a passion for advancing in Technology and have continued to challenge
                myself. It is why I have enrolled in a 10-month Full Stack Web development program at Pursuit to
                advance my skills, get out of my comfort zone, and ultimately give back to my community to a new
                generation ready to learn how to code.
                <br><br>
                Thank you to all of my family, friends, mentors and colleagues who have shaped me along the
                way and allowed me to cross the opportunity divide in this country. I hope to continue paving the way
                for a new generation to excel and finally close the opportunity gap once and for all. Until then, I
                will continue working, coding, learning, and moving forward in yet Another Year Up in my life.
